	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity describes how an algorithm's runtime scales with the size of its input (n). It's about the growth rate, not the exact time in seconds efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> describes how an algorithm's memory usage scales with the size of its input (n). It focuses on the extra space needed.</p>
